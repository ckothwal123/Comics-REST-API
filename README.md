# Comics-REST-API

• Developed an application in Django that scrapes different websites for heart and brain, Garfield and Calvin Hobbs comics
using beautiful soup library and stores them in a MySQL database.<br>
• The application schedules Celery background tasks through RabbitMQ to scrape the comics.<br>
• The application is built using Django REST Framework (DRF) to provide RESTful API’s to the end user to access these
comics. Users can also upload new comics through REST API endpoint.
